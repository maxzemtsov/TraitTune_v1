# Backend Refactoring: assessmentDataService.js Update

**Date:** May 10, 2025

**Objective:** Refactor `assessmentDataService.js` to remove in-memory caching and mock data loading, ensuring all data retrieval and persistence operations are performed directly and asynchronously against the Supabase database. This aligns with the user's preference for live data and supports the `async/await` pattern implemented in `assessmentRoutes.js`.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Removal of In-Memory Cache and Mock Data Logic:**
    *   The `cache` object, `CACHE_TTL_MS`, and `MOCK_DATA_DIR` constant were removed.
    *   Functions `loadMockData()`, `loadDataFromDBAndCache()`, `refreshDataCache()`, `initializeAndCacheData()`, and `dataInitializationPromise` were removed.
    *   The `getCacheStatus` export was removed.
    *   The service no longer relies on `process.env.USE_MOCK_DATA`.

2.  **Direct Asynchronous Database Operations:**
    *   All data getter functions (`getQuestions`, `getOpenQuestions`, `getAnswerOptions`, `getAnswerOptionsForQuestion`, `getSegments`, `getInterpretationTemplates`, `getQuestionById`, `getOpenQuestionById`, `getAnchorQuestions`) were rewritten as `async` functions.
    *   These functions now directly call a new helper function `executeQuery(sql, params)` which uses the `query` function imported from `../config/db` (assumed to be the Supabase client interface).
    *   SQL queries are executed directly against the database for each request to these service methods, ensuring data is always live.

3.  **Implementation of Data Persistence Functions:**
    *   `saveUserResponse(responseData)`: 
        *   Implemented as an `async` function.
        *   Constructs and executes an SQL `INSERT` statement to save individual user responses into the `user_responses` table.
        *   Includes basic validation for required fields (`userId`, `sessionId`, `questionId`, `answerCode`).
        *   Returns the newly inserted row.
    *   `saveUserDimensionResult(resultData)`:
        *   Implemented as an `async` function.
        *   Constructs and executes an SQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` (upsert) statement to save or update final dimension results in the `user_results` table.
        *   Assumes a unique constraint on `(user_id, session_id, dimension_id)` for the upsert logic.
        *   Includes basic validation for required fields.
        *   Returns the inserted or updated row.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   The `executeQuery` helper function includes a try-catch block to log detailed error information (message, SQL, params) and re-throws a generic error to be handled by the calling route or service.
    *   Getter functions for specific IDs (`getQuestionById`, `getOpenQuestionById`, `getAnswerOptionsForQuestion`, `getAnchorQuestions`) include basic validation for the provided ID parameters to prevent invalid database queries.

5.  **SQL Queries:**
    *   SQL queries for data retrieval have been maintained or slightly adjusted for direct execution (e.g., `LIMIT 2` in `getAnchorQuestions`).
    *   SQL for `saveUserResponse` is a simple `INSERT`.
    *   SQL for `saveUserDimensionResult` uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` for upsert functionality.

**Impact and Rationale:**

*   **Live Data:** The primary benefit is that the application will always use the most current data from the database, eliminating issues related to stale cache or reliance on mock files during development and production.
*   **Simplified Logic:** Removing the caching layer simplifies the service's logic and reduces potential points of failure.
*   **Alignment with Async Routes:** The `async` nature of these service methods directly supports the `async/await` patterns now used in `assessmentRoutes.js`.
*   **Database as Single Source of Truth:** Reinforces the database as the single source of truth for all assessment-related data, as per user preference and best practices.
*   **Performance Considerations:** While direct DB calls on every request might have performance implications compared to a cache, this can be addressed later with more sophisticated caching strategies (e.g., Redis, database-level caching) if performance becomes a bottleneck. For the current stage of development and ensuring data integrity, direct DB access is prioritized.

**Next Steps:**

*   Verify that the `../config/db` module correctly exports an `async query` function compatible with the Supabase client (e.g., `supabase.rpc` or `supabase.from().select()`, etc., adapted to a generic `query(sql, params)` interface if necessary).
*   Thoroughly test all refactored service methods, especially the new persistence functions, through integration tests.
*   Update or create integration tests for `assessmentRoutes.js` to ensure they correctly interact with the now fully asynchronous `assessmentDataService.js` and that data is persisted as expected.
