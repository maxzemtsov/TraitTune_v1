# Backend Refactoring: assessmentRoutes.js Update

**Date:** May 10, 2025

**Objective:** Refactor `assessmentRoutes.js` to use `async/await` for improved readability and to integrate database persistence logic for user responses and assessment results, addressing previously identified test failures and integration gaps.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Async/Await Refactoring:**
    *   All route handlers (`/questions`, `/start/:dimensionId`, `/response`) have been converted to `async` functions.
    *   Calls to `dataService` functions (e.g., `getQuestions()`, `getAnchorQuestions()`, `getQuestionById()`, `getAnswerOptionsForQuestion()`) are now `await`ed, assuming these service methods will be updated to perform asynchronous database operations.

2.  **Session ID Management:**
    *   A `sessionId` is now expected to be part of the user's authenticated request (`req.user.sessionId`) or generated as a placeholder (`session_${Date.now()}`) in the `/start/:dimensionId` route.
    *   The `sessionId` is stored in the `userDimensionState` and used when persisting data.

3.  **Database Persistence for User Responses:**
    *   In the `/response` route, after a response is processed and before theta estimation, a call to `dataService.saveUserResponse()` has been added.
    *   This function is intended to save individual user responses to the database. The payload includes `userId`, `sessionId`, `questionId`, raw `answerCode`, and the `dichotomousResponse`.
    *   Error handling (try-catch) is included for this database operation.

4.  **Database Persistence for Dimension Results:**
    *   When an assessment dimension is completed (either by reaching `MAX_QUESTIONS_PER_DIMENSION`, achieving `TARGET_CONFIDENCE_SCORE`, or running out of suitable questions), a call to `dataService.saveUserDimensionResult()` has been added.
    *   This function is intended to save the final state of the dimension assessment to the database. The payload includes `userId`, `sessionId`, `dimensionId`, final `theta`, `segmentId` (assuming the segment object has an `id`), `confidenceScore`, and `completed` status.
    *   Error handling (try-catch) is included for this database operation.

5.  **State Management:**
    *   The in-memory `userStates` object remains for managing the active state of an assessment dimension during a user's session.
    *   The `sessionId` is now also stored within each `userDimensionState`.

6.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Basic `console.error` logging is maintained for internal server errors and database operation failures.
    *   Status codes (200, 400, 404, 500) are returned as appropriate.

**Addressing Previous Issues (Based on `test_failures_and_fixes.md`):**

*   **TF1 & TF2 (Confidence/No-More-Questions Completion Logic):** The core logic for determining completion remains similar, but the refactoring to `async/await` and the separation of concerns with `dataService` calls for persistence should make debugging these conditions more straightforward. The actual fix for these test failures will depend on the correct implementation of `dataService` and the interaction with the updated state. The return structure for completion scenarios was preserved.
*   **TF3 (Premature Completion/State Issue):** The logic for resetting state in `/start/:dimensionId` if a dimension was previously completed has been kept. The issue of premature completion in tests might still require careful review of the test sequence and how `userStates` is managed or reset between test calls. The current change ensures that if a dimension is marked `completed` in `userDimensionState`, new responses are not processed, which should help isolate this test case.
*   **G3 (Lack of Backend Data Persistence):** This is directly addressed by adding calls to `dataService.saveUserResponse()` and `dataService.saveUserDimensionResult()`. The actual persistence logic will reside within `assessmentDataService.js`.

**Assumptions & Next Steps for `assessmentDataService.js`:**

*   `assessmentDataService.js` methods (`getQuestions`, `getAnchorQuestions`, `getQuestionById`, `getAnswerOptionsForQuestion`, `saveUserResponse`, `saveUserDimensionResult`) need to be implemented or updated to perform asynchronous operations against the Supabase database.
*   The `saveUserResponse` method should insert records into a table like `user_responses`.
*   The `saveUserDimensionResult` method should insert or update records in a table like `user_results`.
*   The schema for these tables must align with the data being passed.

**Impact on Tests:**

*   Existing integration tests in `assessment.integration.test.js` will likely require updates:
    *   Mocking for `dataService` methods will need to be adjusted to handle `async` functions (e.g., `mockResolvedValue` instead of `mockReturnValue`).
    *   Assertions might need to be updated if the response structure or timing changes due to asynchronous operations.
    *   The `authenticateToken` middleware is still commented out globally in `assessmentRoutes.js` but applied to individual routes. For testing, this usually involves mocking `req.user`.

This refactoring lays a critical foundation for robust data handling and prepares the backend for more reliable integration testing.
