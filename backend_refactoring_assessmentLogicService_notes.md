# Backend Refactoring: assessmentLogicService.js Update

**Date:** May 10, 2025

**Objective:** Refactor `assessmentLogicService.js` to ensure its functions correctly integrate with the updated asynchronous `assessmentDataService.js`, particularly for fetching segment definitions.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Asynchronous `getSegmentForTheta` Function:**
    *   The `getSegmentForTheta(theta, dimensionId)` function has been converted to an `async` function.
    *   It now `await`s the call to `assessmentDataService.getSegments()` to fetch segment definitions directly from the database. This replaces the previous synchronous call `getSegments()` which relied on a cached or mock data version from the older `assessmentDataService`.
    *   The core logic for filtering segments by `dimensionId`, sorting them by `segment_level`, and determining the appropriate segment based on `theta_min` and `theta_max` remains the same.

2.  **Dependency Update:**
    *   The `require("./assessmentDataService")` statement at the top of the file now correctly imports the refactored `assessmentDataService` which exports async, direct-DB methods.

3.  **No Changes to Core Calculation Logic:**
    *   The psychometric calculation functions (`calculate2PLProbability`, `getDichotomousResponse`, `estimateTheta`, `calculateConfidenceScore`) remain synchronous as their logic is self-contained and does not involve direct I/O operations that would necessitate `async/await`.
    *   The `estimateTheta` function still contains placeholder logic for IRT estimation and standard error calculation, which is noted in the code comments and should be addressed in future psychometric refinement tasks.

**Impact and Rationale:**

*   **Integration with Async Data Layer:** This change ensures that `assessmentLogicService.js` correctly consumes data from the refactored `assessmentDataService.js`, which now provides live data asynchronously from the database.
*   **Consistency:** Aligns `getSegmentForTheta` with the overall `async/await` pattern adopted in the backend services for data-dependent operations.
*   **Data Accuracy:** By fetching segments directly from the database via the async service call, `getSegmentForTheta` will always use the most up-to-date segment definitions.

**Next Steps:**

*   Thoroughly test the `getSegmentForTheta` function, especially its interaction with the live data from `assessmentDataService.getSegments()`, as part of the broader integration testing of the assessment flow.
*   Review and refine the placeholder IRT logic in `estimateTheta` as per the project's psychometric roadmap.
