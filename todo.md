## Phase 5: CI/CD & Deployment Infrastructure (GitHub & Netlify)

### 5.1 GitHub Repository & Workflow
- [/] Set up the TraitTune GitHub repository (if not already fully configured by user).
- [/] Implement and enforce the defined branching strategy (`pilot` for staging/QA, `main` for production, feature/fix branches).
- [/] Configure PR templates, automated checks (linting, tests, build), and semantic commit message conventions.

### 5.2 CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- [/] **Frontend (Netlify with GitHub Actions)**: Configure CI/CD using GitHub Actions for the Next.js/React SPA, deploying to Netlify. This provides greater control and cost-effectiveness.
    - [x] **Disable Netlify Automatic Builds**: In Netlify site settings (Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Build settings), select "Stop builds".
    - [x] **`netlify.toml` Configuration**: Ensure a `netlify.toml` file is in the project root, specifying the build command (e.g., `npm run build`), publish directory (e.g., `.next` or `out`), and the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin. Example:
        ```toml
        [build]
          command = "npm run build"
          publish = ".next"
        [[plugins]]
          package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
        ```
    - [x] **Install Netlify CLI**: Add `netlify-cli` as a dev dependency (`npm install -D netlify-cli` or `yarn add -D netlify-cli`).
    - [x] **GitHub Secrets Setup**:
        - [ ] Create `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (Netlify Personal Access Token) and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (Netlify Site API ID) as encrypted secrets in the GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions).
    - [x] **GitHub Actions Workflow for Preview/Staging (`pilot` branch)**:
        - [x] Create `.github/workflows/netlify-preview.yml`.
        - [x] Workflow should: checkout code, setup Node.js, install dependencies, run tests (unit/E2E), build the project (`npm run build`), and deploy to Netlify using `netlify deploy --dir=.next --alias=pilot-preview` (or a PR-specific alias like `deploy-preview-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`) with the stored secrets.
    - [x] **GitHub Actions Workflow for Production (`main` branch)**:
        - [x] Create `.github/workflows/netlify-production.yml`.
        - [x] Workflow should: checkout code, setup Node.js, install dependencies, run tests, build the project, and deploy to Netlify using `netlify deploy --dir=.next --prod` with the stored secrets.
    - [x] **Automated Testing Integration**: Ensure both workflows include steps to run automated tests (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`) before build/deployment, failing the workflow if tests don't pass.
    - [x] **Landing Page Deployment**: If `traittune.com` is a separate Netlify site, configure its CI/CD with GitHub Actions similarly.
- [ ] **Backend (Provider TBD)**: Plan and configure CI/CD for Fastify microservices (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless functions on a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or potentially Netlify Functions if suitable).
    - [ ] This section needs further detail once backend hosting/deployment strategy is confirmed.
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Securely configure all environment variables and secrets (API keys, database credentials, LLM keys, ConfigCat keys) for all environments (dev, staging, production) in Netlify and backend hosting provider.

### 5.3 Netlify Project Configuration (for Frontend)
- [ ] Set up Netlify projects for the frontend SPA (`app.traittune.com`) and landing page (`traittune.com`).
- [ ] Configure custom domains, DNS, and SSL certificates.
- [ ] Investigate and configure Netlify Edge Functions or Cloudflare for DDoS protection, and potentially as a proxy for backend APIs if applicable.

### 5.4 Build, Deployment & Verification
- [ ] Conduct initial test deployments of the frontend to Netlify staging and production environments.
- [ ] Verify build integrity, successful deployment, and core functionality on the live URLs.
- [ ] Conduct initial test deployments of backend services to their respective environments.

## Phase 6: Production Readiness & MVP Release

### 6.1 Production Environment Finalization
- [ ] Finalize all production environment configurations, including environment variables, database settings (Supabase production instance), and third-party service integrations (LLMs, ConfigCat).
- [ ] Ensure production-grade logging (Pino to Logtail) and error tracking (Sentry) are fully operational for both frontend and backend.
- [ ] Verify health check endpoints (`/healthz`) for all backend microservices are active and reporting correctly.

### 6.2 Monitoring & Alerting Setup
- [ ] Configure comprehensive monitoring dashboards (e.g., using Netlify Analytics, Supabase monitoring, Logtail, Sentry, or other tools) for key application performance metrics, infrastructure health, API usage, and error rates.
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, security events, and resource exhaustion.

### 6.3 Pre-Release Final Checklist
- [ ] Conduct a final QA sweep on the production candidate build (from `main` branch deployed to staging).
- [ ] Confirm all legal and compliance requirements are met (GDPR consent banners, links to Privacy Notice & ToS).
- [ ] Review and finalize user-facing release notes and any initial user documentation or FAQs.

### 6.4 MVP Launch
- [ ] Execute the deployment of the MVP to the production environment (e.g., merge `pilot` to `main` for Netlify frontend deployment, deploy backend services).
- [ ] Perform post-deployment smoke tests to ensure core functionality is working as expected.
- [ ] Officially announce the MVP release to relevant stakeholders and/or initial user groups.

### 6.5 Post-Launch Monitoring & Support
- [ ] Closely monitor application health, performance, and user feedback in the initial days/weeks post-launch.
- [ ] Be prepared to address any urgent bugs or issues with hotfixes.
- [ ] Begin planning for the first post-MVP iteration based on collected data and feedback.
## Phase 7: Post-MVP Strategic Initiatives (Future Planning)

### 7.1 Psychometric Validation & Research with Real Users
- [ ] **Data Collection Strategy**: Define and implement a strategy for systematic collection and anonymization of real user assessment data for research purposes.
- [ ] **Ongoing Psychometric Analysis**: Plan for regular psychometric analysis (reliability, validity, DIF) using real user data to refine the assessment and ensure its continued accuracy and fairness.
- [ ] **Research Initiatives**: Outline potential research studies that can be conducted using the collected data to further validate and enhance TraitTune.

### 7.2 Simulated User Testing & IRT Recalibration
- [ ] **Simulation Framework Development**: Design and develop a framework for generating 500-1000 simulated user profiles and their assessment responses based on defined trait distributions.
- [ ] **Simulated Testing Execution**: Conduct large-scale simulated testing using the generated user data.
- [ ] **IRT Parameter Recalibration**: Use the data from simulated testing to recalibrate the 2PL IRT parameters (difficulty 'b', discrimination 'a') for all core questions to improve measurement precision and model fit.
- [ ] **Database Enrichment**: Populate the database with simulated user data to aid in testing and further development of analytics features.

### 7.3 Self-Hosted Open-Source LLM & TTS Deployment (AWS)
- [ ] **Feasibility Study & Model Selection**: Research and select suitable open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, VLama, Deepseek) and TTS models (e.g., NariLabs) that meet TraitTune's workflow requirements.
- [ ] **AWS Infrastructure Planning**: Design the AWS infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, SageMaker, S3) required to host, manage, and scale the selected open-source models, leveraging available AWS credits.
- [ ] **Deployment & Integration Plan**: Develop a plan for deploying these models on AWS and integrating them into the TraitTune backend microservices, replacing or supplementing commercial API calls.
- [ ] **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Perform a cost-benefit analysis comparing self-hosting on AWS versus continued use of commercial LLM APIs.
