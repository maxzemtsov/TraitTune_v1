## TraitTune MVP - Project Status Summary (May 07 2025)

This summary is based on a review of `todo.md` and a file listing (`ls -R`) of the `/home/ubuntu` directory.

**Overall Impression:**
The project has foundational structures in place for both backend and frontend. Many UI components and basic configurations are present. However, most core logic, full feature implementations, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation require further development or verification through code inspection.

--- 
**Phase-by-Phase Status:**

**Phase 1: Core Feature Development & Completion**

*   **1.1 Backend Development (Fastify Microservices)**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Scaffolding & Initial Setup)
    *   **Evidence:** `traittune_backend` directory with `engine`, `llm_bridge`, `report`, `scoring` subdirectories exists. `traittune_backend/migrations/0000_initial.sql` for database setup is present.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Implementation of specific microservice logic (session management, adaptive question selection, IRT, trait level estimation, report generation, LLM API integration, GDPR `delete_user_cascade`, bilingual support) needs code inspection to confirm completion beyond scaffolding.

*   **1.2 Frontend Development (Next.js/React SPA)**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Core UI Components & Basic Structure)
    *   **Evidence:** Extensive `traittune_frontend` directory. Key UI components (`ChatInput.tsx`, `ChatWindow.tsx`, `MessageBubble.tsx`), a comprehensive `src/components/ui` library, `src/gamification_setup_outline.js`, and `src/lib/apiClient.ts` are present. `src/locales/en.json` and `ru.json` exist.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Full implementation and logic for Onboarding Flow (Supabase Auth, CAPTCHA, metadata forms, LinkedIn fetch, consent), adaptive question display, WebSocket integration, all report rendering types, complete gamification UI logic, retake logic, and adherence to Design System Specifications with `@traittune/ui` require code inspection.

*   **1.3 Integration**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Initial Setup)
    *   **Evidence:** `traittune_frontend/src/lib/apiClient.ts` suggests initial setup for frontend-backend communication.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Seamless data flow for the entire assessment lifecycle and LLM response integration require code inspection and testing.

**Phase 2: Bug Fixing, Polish & Performance Optimization**

*   **2.1 Bug Fixing**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (i18n issue for calendar)
    *   **Evidence:** `calendar.tsx` exists, `date-fns` is installed.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Confirmation that the `calendar.tsx` i18n issue is resolved. Status of other critical/high-priority bugs.

*   **2.2 UI/UX Polish & Accessibility**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED / PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (UI components exist)
    *   **Evidence:** UI components are available from `src/components/ui`.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Thorough UI/UX review, optimization of user flows, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance require dedicated effort and testing.

*   **2.3 Performance Optimization**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Evidence:** No direct evidence of caching strategies (Redis, CDN) or specific optimization work from file listing.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Frontend load times, bundle sizes, API response times, database query optimization.

**Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance**

*   **3.1 Unit & Integration Testing**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Frontend tests initiated)
    *   **Evidence:** `traittune_frontend/tests` directory with `assessment.spec.ts`, `onboarding.spec.ts`, `reporting.spec.ts`.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Backend unit/integration test coverage (no obvious test directories in backend microservices). Achieving â‰¥ 80% statement coverage for frontend tests (Vitest usage to be confirmed from `package.json`).

*   **3.2 End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Playwright)**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Frontend test files exist)
    *   **Evidence:** Frontend `.spec.ts` files in `traittune_frontend/tests` are candidates.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Playwright setup and configuration (e.g., in `package.json` or test setup files) and comprehensive E2E test coverage for all flows in EN & RU.

*   **3.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Process item)

*   **3.4 Security Testing**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Beyond initial RLS planning for DB)
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** RLS policy implementation verification, OWASP Top 10 testing, rate limiting, GDPR compliance feature testing.

*   **3.5 Performance & Load Testing**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Process item)

**Phase 4: Documentation, Security & Compliance Finalization**

*   **4.1 Technical Documentation**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Basic READMEs and CI/CD plan)
    *   **Evidence:** `README.md` files in backend and frontend. `todo.md` contains CI/CD setup details.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI specs), detailed frontend/backend architecture documents, deployment procedures beyond CI/CD plan.

*   **4.2 Security & Compliance Documentation**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Evidence:** No specific files for RLS documentation, GDPR strategy, Privacy Notice, or ToS found in the file listing.

**Phase 5: CI/CD & Deployment Infrastructure (GitHub & Netlify)**

*   **5.1 GitHub Repository & Workflow**
    *   **Status:** PLANNED / PARTIALLY STARTED (Conceptual setup in todo.md)
    *   **Evidence:** `todo.md` details branching strategy, PR templates.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Actual setup in the GitHub repository, including `.github/workflows` directory and its content (workflow files not yet created based on `ls -R`).

*   **5.2 CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (Frontend configuration started, Backend TBD)
    *   **Evidence:** `netlify.toml` exists in `traittune_frontend`. `netlify-cli` is a dev dependency. `todo.md` details GitHub Actions workflow files to be created for the frontend.
    *   **Gaps/To Verify:** Creation of actual GitHub Actions workflow files (`netlify-preview.yml`, `netlify-production.yml`). Backend CI/CD strategy and implementation. Secrets management setup in GitHub.

*   **5.3 Netlify Project Configuration (for Frontend)**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED (External configuration)

*   **5.4 Build, Deployment & Verification**
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Process item, depends on CI/CD setup)

**Phase 6: Production Readiness & MVP Release**
*   **Status:** NOT STARTED (Depends on completion of prior phases)

**Phase 7: Post-MVP Strategic Initiatives**
*   **Status:** PLANNED (Documented in `todo.md`)

**Potential Issues / Items Needing Clarification:**

*   **Duplicate Migrations:** Presence of `traittune_backend/migrations/0000_initial.sql` and `traittune_frontend/migrations/0001_initial.sql`. The frontend migration file might be misplaced or indicate a different purpose that needs clarification.
*   **`@traittune/ui` library usage:** `todo.md` mentions using this library, but its presence or integration needs verification from `package.json` or code.
*   **Backend Testing Framework:** No clear indication of a testing framework or test files for the backend microservices.

---
**Next Steps (Recommendations):**

1.  **Code Inspection:** Prioritize code inspection for core backend and frontend features to accurately determine completion levels.
2.  **Update `todo.md`:** Mark items in `todo.md` with current statuses (e.g., [x] for done, [/] for in progress, [ ] for not started) based on this review and subsequent code inspections.
3.  **Clarify Migration Strategy:** Understand the purpose of the frontend migration file.
4.  **Backend Testing:** Define and implement a testing strategy for backend microservices.
5.  **GitHub Workflows:** Create the planned `.github/workflows` files for frontend CI/CD.
