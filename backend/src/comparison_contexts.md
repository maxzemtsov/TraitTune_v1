## TraitTune Group Comparison Contexts

This document outlines predefined template contexts for comparing users in a group dynamic setting. These contexts can be selected by users after initiating a comparison (e.g., via QR code scan between two existing users).

### 1. Collaboration Style Compatibility

*   **Focus:** How well two individuals might work together on a typical project.
*   **Relevant Traits (Examples):**
    *   Cooperative vs. Independent
    *   Structured vs. Flexible
    *   Communicative (Expressive vs. Reserved)
    *   Conflict Resolution Style (derived from multiple traits)
*   **Output Insight Snippets (Examples for a pair):
    *   "User A's preference for structure complements User B's adaptability, potentially leading to well-organized yet flexible teamwork."
    *   "Both users lean towards independent work; clear role definition will be key for synergy."
    *   "User A is more expressive, while User B is more reserved. Encourage User B to share insights proactively."

### 2. Innovation and Problem-Solving Approach

*   **Focus:** How a pair might approach novel challenges and generate ideas.
*   **Relevant Traits (Examples):**
    *   Innovative vs. Pragmatic
    *   Risk-Taking vs. Cautious
    *   Analytical vs. Intuitive (or Empathetic)
    *   Openness to Experience (derived)
*   **Output Insight Snippets (Examples for a pair):
    *   "User A's innovative mindset paired with User B's pragmatic approach can turn creative ideas into actionable plans."
    *   "Both users are comfortable with risk, which could lead to bold solutions but may require a designated 'devil's advocate'."
    *   "User A's analytical depth and User B's intuitive insights offer a balanced perspective on complex problems."

### 3. Leadership and Influence Dynamics

*   **Focus:** How leadership and influence might be distributed or shared between two individuals.
*   **Relevant Traits (Examples):**
    *   Dominant vs. Accommodating (or Assertive vs. Passive)
    *   Proactive vs. Reactive
    *   Persuasiveness (derived)
    *   Empathy (in leadership context)
*   **Output Insight Snippets (Examples for a pair):
    *   "User A's proactive style may naturally take the lead, while User B's accommodating nature can foster team cohesion."
    *   "Both users exhibit strong leadership traits; they might co-lead effectively or need to define clear areas of responsibility."
    *   "User B's empathetic approach can be highly influential in building consensus around User A's initiatives."

### 4. Stress Response and Resilience

*   **Focus:** How a pair might react to pressure and support each other in challenging situations.
*   **Relevant Traits (Examples):**
    *   Resilient vs. Reactive (or Sensitive)
    *   Optimistic vs. Realistic (or Pessimistic)
    *   Composure (derived)
*   **Output Insight Snippets (Examples for a pair):
    *   "User A's resilience can be a steadying force for User B during high-pressure moments."
    *   "Both users maintain optimism under stress, creating a positive and enduring team environment."
    *   "User B's realistic outlook can help ground User A's optimism, ensuring preparedness."

### Implementation Notes:

*   The backend will need a mechanism to fetch relevant trait scores for the two users being compared.
*   Based on the selected context, specific trait combinations will be analyzed.
*   The insights should be generated (possibly using predefined templates or a simple rule engine for MVP) based on the users' scores on these traits.
*   The frontend will display these contexts as selectable options and then show the generated insights.
